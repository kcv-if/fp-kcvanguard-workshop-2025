## 🧠 Project Overview

This project presents a two-stage Natural Language Processing (NLP) system that performs:

1. **Toxic Comment Classification** — Detecting whether a comment contains toxicity and categorizing it (e.g., Insult, Threat, Sexual Harassment).
2. **Comment Detoxification** — Rewriting toxic comments into more respectful, non-harmful alternatives, while preserving their original intent.

We built and deployed the system using **Gradio** on **Google Colab**, and published our models on **Hugging Face** for public access.  
Our goal is to foster healthier online communication by transforming offensive language rather than deleting it outright.

(But don’t worry — in our case, it’s reversed: we heal toxic comments instead of harming others.)
